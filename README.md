# ConnectedXM Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

ConnectedXM ("we", "us", "our") values the privacy of all users ("user", "you", "your") who engage with our applications and services. This Privacy Policy sets forth our commitment and outlines our practices with respect to managing your personal information. It explains the types of information we collect, how we use and protect this information, and the choices you can make about how your information is used and shared.

## 2. Information Collection and Use

We collect and process personal data that you voluntarily provide to us, information collected through third parties, and data collected via cookies and other tracking technologies. This data may include, but is not limited to, your email address, phone number, name, physical address, bio, social links, and device information for the purpose of sending notifications. We process this data to facilitate in-person experiences, provide you with relevant notifications, and to enable you to maintain a social account on our platform.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect. While we do not engage in the sale of your personal information, we may share your information with our clients using our white label solution. This is done to support the operation of the online communities and social platforms. We will not share your personal data with any other third parties unless we obtain your express consent or are compelled by law to do so.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data; please see the User Rights section below for further information.

## 5. Security

Your data security is of utmost importance to us. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption, SSL, and adherence to best practices in security protocols.

## 6. User Rights

You possess certain rights with respect to your personal information under applicable law. You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal information at any time. All personal information can be modified from within your account. Historical transactional information cannot be deleted unless specifically requested.

## 7. Communications

Unless users expressly opt into our newsletter, all emails from ConnectedXM are transactional in nature. Users can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of our communications.

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age specified, please contact us at support@connectedxm.com, and we will endeavour to delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 10. Third-Party Links

Our service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by ConnectedXM.

## 11. International Users

ConnectedXM is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are accessing the service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the service will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the U.S. The data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of the country in which you are located. Your use of the service or providing us with any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information in the U.S. as set out in this Privacy Policy.

## 12. Data Breach Procedures

In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, ConnectedXM will notify you and relevant authorities as required by applicable law. This notification will occur as soon as reasonably possible, considering the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the integrity of our system.

## 13. Dispute Resolution

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection to this Privacy Policy will be resolved through good faith negotiations. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, then it may be resolved by final and binding arbitration conducted in accordance with and subject to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in [Your city, Your state], before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties.

## 14. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.
